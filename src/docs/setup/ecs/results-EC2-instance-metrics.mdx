1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**

Letâ€™s go to CloudWatch console and select Log groups from the left side navigation. Search for our log group
name `/aws/ecs/containerinsights/{ClusterName}/performance`  and then click the log stream name which is your `NodeTelemetry-{containerInstanceId}`.
We should see our expected (following) metrics. These logs use the CloudWatch [Embedded Metric
Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html) (EMF)
to generate CloudWatch Metrics. Following is an example for received logs in the CloudWatch console.

In the CloudWatch Console, from the left side panel, select Metrics. You should be able to see ECS/ContainerInsights namespace.
